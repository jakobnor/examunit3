What My Code Does

I Made a Symbol Translator

☉ = Gold (Au)

☿ = Mercury (Hg)

☽ = Silver (Ag)

♂ = Iron (Fe)
Like translating secret symbols to modern science names.

I Built a Code Breaker
Takes symbols like "☉☿☽♂☉" and changes them to "AuHgAgFeAu" automatically.

I Talk to the Game Server

Ask for puzzles: "What's this code?"

Send answers: "Here's my solution: AuHgAgFeAu"

The Problem Now:
After sending the correct answer, the game replies with:
"Friend, we are close... (repeats the same message)"
instead of saying "You won! Here's your key: ALCHEMY123".

What's Wrong:
My code expects a nice computer message (JSON) but gets regular text.
It's like expecting a letter in an envelope but getting a sticky note instead.
